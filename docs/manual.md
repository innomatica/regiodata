## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why (all time) location permission is required?

App detects the location of the phone using 

* WiFi AP information (AP name and BSSID)
* Information from phone's Location Service (longitude, latitude, elevation)

**Both** require location permission. 

* User has to allow **all time** permission since app uses it at the background. 
* User has to do it **manually** because app is not allowed to handle it inside.

### How to grant location permission?

Find App location permission page by

* either `Settings > Apps > Loco > Permissions > Location`
* or `Settings > Location > App location permissions > Loco`

Select `Allow all the time`
